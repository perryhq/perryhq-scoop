Scoop bucket with my own apps and apps that haven't been added to the official buckets 

## How do I install these manifests?

After manifests have been committed and pushed, run the following:

```pwsh
scoop bucket add <bucketname> https://github.com/<username>/<bucketname>
scoop install <bucketname>/<manifestname>
```

## How do I contribute new manifests?

You can if you want to but I don't know why you would.

To make a new manifest contribution, please read the [Contributing
Guide](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/.github/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
and [App Manifests](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop/wiki/App-Manifests)
wiki page.
